# Introduction

## Overview

There are university, college and online courses for software development as a discipline.
This course's focus is to extend the general principles of computers science into enterprise application development practices, explore common patterns and to learn to recognize common anti-patterns.

Enterprise software is diverse, built using different programming languages, leveraging different middleware and back-ends, utilizing divergent user interfaces, and, generally, is messy.
There is no single solution, programming language or even a single vendor that offers the best solution for every problem.
The agenda of the course is a mile-wide and an inch deep coverage of software development practices, programming languages, types of user-interfaces, and variety of back-ends.

You will come out of the course with a guidance to recognize a category of enterprise software you are dealing with or need to built. Familiarity with different architecture styles and design patterns.
You will feel more comfortable collaborating with application developers as well as will learn to recognize software development pains and common obstacles.

There is no magic wane at the end of the course to resolve a production issue you may have been struggling with or to finish a software project that has been falling behind for months.
There are recipes to consider and common solutions to help collaboration with application developers and to deliver your next initiative in a more predictable fashion.
Anti-patterns are common, tech debt is a norm, nothing ever seems to run smoothly - let's learn how to reduce the symptoms until the a vaccine is here.

You will experience different approaches with pragmatic hands-on labs and group discussions.
You will come out more comfortable dealing with typical and/or atypical enterprise software.
